			<p>Hi! My name is Nils and I am a film sound enthusiast specialising in Sound Design and boom operating. I have recently moved to Edinburgh, Scotland to pursue my Sound Design studies at Edinburgh Napier University. Before that I was working in the production sound department, mainly as a boom operator, of international projects around the world and in my home country Germany. Next to working on film shoots I have interned at studios like ‘Rotor Film Babelsberg’ and was able to finish my first films as a Sound Designer, which got screened at international festivals around the world.</p>
			<p>I am also very interested in the writing process of films and have taken Screen Writing courses at the University of Edinburgh.</p>
			<p>I think having experience in various fields of filmmaking is important to have the ‘big picture’ in your head.</p>
			<p>I am now excited to start my studies to learn new fields of Sound Design and to meet interesting people in the United Kingdom.</p>
